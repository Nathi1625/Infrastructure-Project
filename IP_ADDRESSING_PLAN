# IP Addressing Plan (Reference)

This document describes the WAN and LAN IP addressing scheme used in the network topology.  
The design follows a structured, scalable, and easy-to-troubleshoot approach.

## WAN Links

Point-to-point WAN links use **/30 subnets** to conserve IP space.

| Link                  | Subnet         | Core IP     | Branch IP  |
|-----------------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Core ↔ Midrand        | 10.20.1.0/30   | 10.20.1.1  | 10.20.1.2 |
| Core ↔ Centurion      | 10.20.2.0/30   | 10.20.2.1  | 10.20.2.2 |
| Core ↔ Pretoria       | 10.20.3.0/30   | 10.20.3.1  | 10.20.3.2 |
| Core ↔ Internet       | 10.20.4.0/30   | 10.20.4.1  | 10.20.4.2 |

## Site LANs

Each site is segmented using **VLANs**, with a dedicated `/24` subnet per VLAN.  
The gateway address is always the first usable IP in the subnet.

| Site            | VLAN | Subnet           | Gateway       |
|-----------------|------|------------------|---------------|
| Midrand         | 10   | 172.16.10.0/24   | 172.16.10.1  |
| Centurion       | 20   | 172.16.20.0/24   | 172.16.20.1  |
| Pretoria        | 30   | 172.16.30.0/24   | 172.16.30.1  |
| Data Centre 1   | 40   | 172.16.40.0/24   | 172.16.40.1  |
| Data Centre 2   | 50   | 172.16.50.0/24   | 172.16.50.1  |

## Design Notes

- WAN links use **/30** addressing for point-to-point efficiency  
- LANs use **/24** subnets for simplicity and scalability  
- VLAN IDs map directly to subnet numbering for clarity  
- Gateway IPs are standardized as `.1` across all VLANs  

---

## Use Case

This IP plan is intended for:
- Enterprise network simulations (GNS3 / Proxmox)
- Monitoring and observability labs
- Routing, firewall, and VLAN demonstrations
- ITSM, AIOps, and network management testing
